<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup 
    language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
    It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
    and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server 
    or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
    HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included
     cues for the appearance of the document.

<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>C is often called a middle-level computer language. This does not mean that C is less powerful,
    harder to use, or less developed than a high-level language such as BASIC or Pascal, nor does it
    imply that C has the cumbersome nature of assembly language (and its associated troubles). Rather,
    C is thought of as a middle-level language because it combines the best elements of high-level
    languages with the control and flexibility of assembly language. Table 1-1 shows how C fits into the
    spectrum of computer languages.</p>

<h2>JAVA SCRIPT </h2>
<p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[9] often abbreviated as JS, is a
    programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
   [10] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and 
   multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
    prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
   Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies 
   of the World Wide Web.[11] Over 97% of websites use it client-side 
   for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.
   [13] Most web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute 
   the code on the user's device.</p>
